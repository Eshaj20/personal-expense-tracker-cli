# Personal Expense Tracker (CLI)

A lightweight, command-line-based expense tracker built with Python and SQLite for managing daily expenses efficiently.

This project was developed as part of the Evaao internship assignment. It allows users to add, view, update, delete, and summarize their expenses with persistent storage.

python3 expense_tracker.py view --start 2025-09-01 --end 2025-10-05

# Update expense
python3 expense_tracker.py update 1 --amount 300 --note "dinner"

# Delete expense
python3 expense_tracker.py delete 1

# Summary reports
python3 expense_tracker.py summary
python3 expense_tracker.py summary --group-by category

 Assumptions & Design
Date input accepted in YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY.
Internally stored in ISO YYYY-MM-DD format.

Category is optional; default is uncategorized.

Amount must be positive.

Data is stored persistently in a local SQLite database (expenses.db).

The program is dependency-free â€” runs on any system with Python 3.
